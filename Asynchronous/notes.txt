1. javaScript is Sync

2. NodeJS is Async

3. NodeJS is Event Driven Non-Blocking I/O in V8 javaScript

4. Async system events are processed with the help of libuv and 
  event loop  

5. Event loop checks the callback queue

6. BWA - Buffer: A temporary holding spot for data being moved from
         one place to another. Intentially limited in size.

7. BWA - Stream: A sequence of data made available over time. 
         Pieces of data that eventually combine into a whole.

8. BWA - Binary data - Base 2 format data. Either 1 or 0 for
         representing data. Awesome for computers. Easy to phsically represent 
         it - the on and off states. Eg. Disks - a bump or a low

9. In computers - everything we store is in binary i.e. 1s or 0s.
   All types of data are converted to be stored. 

10. BWA - Character set(Unicode or ASCII etc): A representation of characters as numbers.
          Each character gets a number. Unicode and ASCII are character sets.
    Note: For storing letters - We go from letter to number and number itself
           is stored in binary further.

11. BWA - Charcter Encoding(UTF-8 or UTF-16 etc): How characters are stored in binary.
          The numbers(or code points) are converted and stored in binary.
